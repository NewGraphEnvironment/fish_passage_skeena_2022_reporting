## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. The site is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` (also known as Date Creek FSR), just outside the Gitxsan village of Kispiox. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Kispiox River. This crossing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. The `chris_culvert_id` of this structure is 1524775.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198215)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available
for the area upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`[@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs].

The site was revisited in 2023 and electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. During the time of assessment, one culvert had little flowing water while the other had moderate, a significant outlet drop, and deep outlet pool.

fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```


<br>

Two dams were listed as present on Dale Creek at the time of survey. This information was gathered from the Canadian Aquatic Barrier Database, as well as `bcfishpass` [@canadianwildlifefederation2023CanadianAquatic]. The first dam was located approximately 600m upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (`dam_id`: 166c070f-a324-40fb-addb-886dd23a9fc1), and the second one was located 200m further upstream (`dam_id`: 0de8a19d-eb93-4102-b124-8738f27e9e13). The Dale Creek watershed provides the community of Kispiox with domestic water [@rabnett_etal2003KispioxWatershed]. One of the dams is likely the location of drinking water storage and treatment infrastructure.

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198215). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198215)). There was two culverts side by side, but one was not functioning and had debris blocking the outlet. There
was low flow through the functioning culvert at the time of survey. The outlet drop was significant at 1.1m. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

The site was revisited in 2023, one culvert had very little flow and the other had moderate flow. There is a significant outlet drop (~1m) and deep outlet pool on the culvert with moderate flow, which is likely a barrier to upstream fish passage for certain life stages (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-198215-09)).

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the confluence with the Kispiox River
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` This stretch of stream was steep with one lock block step approximately 30m downstream of the culvert that was approximately 1m in height that could block upstream migration for non adult fish species. The lock block was likely placed in this location to backwater the site, minimize the culvert outlet drop and facilitate upstream fish passage. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 


## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There were numerous cascades that were approximately 1m in height at the time of survey, with deep outlet pools. The stream channel was frequently confined and restricted from lateral migration from the valley walls. Significant amounts of large woody debris were found in and around the stream, adding complexity. There were trace amount of gravels suitable for spawning. After the first 500m of the survey, there were logs placed within the streambed perpendicular to the flow direction at regular intervals. It is presumed these logs were placed to capture substrate and provide complexity and spawning/rearing habitat.  The stream was surveyed to the mapped location of a dam. Although the dam was not present there appeared to be some remnants of a historic structure in the form of logs `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-05)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-d03))."))`  The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important migration corridor containing spawning habitat suitable for coho and steelhead and having moderate rearing potential for both species.

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

In 2023, electrofishing was conducted at crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198215) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198215) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198215). A total of `r tab_fish_summary_updated %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream including cutthroat trout and rainbow trout, and `r tab_fish_summary_updated %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream including cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and dolly varden `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-07) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-08)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198215-u01))."))` Due to the crossings proximity to the Kispiox Rover and the significant outlet drop on the culvert with moderate flow, fish passage is likely limited to times of high flow. 

<!-- All fish over 60mm that were captured were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls). -->

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The BC freshwater atlas streamline indicates the stream gradient of the segment upstream of the FSR was 7.5% which coincides approximately with stream measurements.  This value is very near the 7.4% cutoff for modelling steelhead high value rearing habitat so we estimated 0.8km of habitat suitable for steelhead rearing  to a point where mapping indicates gradients increase to 11%. Areas surveyed were rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Although there was no dam structure located where indicated in provincial data layers, Dale Creek watershed does provide the community of Kispiox with domestic water so another dam may be present farther upstream.  The site was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert could be conducted to to provide insight into fish community composition and density to help further inform prioritization.
