## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, just outside the small community of Sik-E-Dakh (Glen Vowell). Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site, col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Skeena River on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)` 300m upstream from `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and appears to be under the jurisdiction of the Sik-E-Dakh 2 Indian Reserve.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

Located on the west side of the Skeena River, between Hazelton and Kispiox, Sik-E-Dakh is a Gitxsan community home to the Glen Vowell Band. "Sik-E-Dakh" means "Bright Lights Behind Mountain" [@SikEDakhGlenVowellBand2023]. The subject stream supplies drinking water to the community with drinking water storage and treatment infrastructure located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)` beyond the location of `r as.character(my_site2)`. The underlying territory of this stream is within the Xsu Wii Masxwit/ Antgililibixw Wilp.

<br>

Approximately 300m north of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` on Kispiox Valley Road, GIS modelling indicates there is a crossing located on Glen Vowell Creek (modelled crossing ID 8300064). This area was canvassed and there was no culvert or structure found. In 2018, [@tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd_2020GlenVowell] electrofished a section of Glen Vowell Creek upstream of modelled crossing 8301266 and captured cutthroat and dolly varden. This stream is mapped as immediately north of the flows east before draining into the Skeena River. Immediately before the confluence, GIS modelling indicates there is a crossing located on Peter Brown Drive (modelled crossing ID 8300001) however, this location was also investigated and there was no crossing found. There are some discrepancies between the mapped stream channel locations in the BC freshwater atlas and the actual on the ground reality. This could be the result of anthroprogenic influences (ie. dredged stream channels or channel redirection due to protection of road and community infrastructure).  

<br>

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198217)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available for the area upstream of the highway crossing `r as.character(my_site)` [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs]. Local knowledge holder (Chief Francis), noted that the local community historically harvested coho from the stream. Gitksan Watershed Authorities and local residents are working together to gather information about the system from elders and other local knowledge holders in the community to help inform watershed restoration planning.  There is concern in the community that the stream flows are not as consistent as in the past and there are hopes that restoration activities could help increase fisheries productivity in the system. There is a network of dykes surrounding the Sik-e-Dakh community.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was embedded, backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)`
to upstream fish passage (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198216)). There were two culverts side by side, and both of them had trash racks on the
inlet side that could be a barrier to adult coho. The trash rack had grid sizes of approximately 13cm by 13cm.

<br>

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was comprised of two pipes.  The outlet drops were measured as 0.6m with both pipes un-embedded and non-backwatered.  The crossing ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198217)). Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

The area downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` consisted of open wetland habitat with shrubs and floodplains. There was a beaver dam approximately 100m downstream of the culvert. Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2)` The area surveyed was mostly wetland habitat, with
three large beaver dams spaced evenly along surveyed length. Multiple channels were present after the first beaver dam, separated by heavily vegetated banks. There was muddy bed material with some fines and
gravels but nothing bigger. More gravels were present closer to crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` that were suitable for spawning. There were abundant deep pools
present near wetland that could be suitable for rearing if habitat is
opened up. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2)` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential for resident and anadromous salmonids. The area immediately upstream of

Three sections of stream were surveyed. The first section was surveyed upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)` Abundant gravels were present
suitable for coho, steelhead, and rainbow spawning. Multiple large beaver dams were present within the area surveyed. The upstream end of site was adjacent to a beaver dam complex. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>

The second section was surveyed on an upstream tributary to the main stream for `r fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us2', sit = my_site2)` There was extensive beaver activity in this section. This was a steeper, smaller stream with extensive areas of gravel suitable for resident and anadronous salmonids. Multiple small steps from large and small woody debris with heights ranging from 20-40cm were present at the time of survey. The stream was surrounded by an old growth riparian forest. The habitat was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us2', sit = my_site2)` value for salmonid
rearing and spawning. 

<br>

The third section was surveyed on a tributary to the mainstem for `r fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us3', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us3', sit = my_site2)` This is a major contributing tributary to downstream flow. Abundant gravels were present suitable for spawning. There were sporadic pools suitable for juvenile coho and steelhead overwintering. The mature old growth mixed riparian provided a stable channel and large woody debris. Wildlife trails were found throughout the forest. The habitat was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us3', sit = my_site2)` value for salmonid
rearing and spawning.

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted at crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` in 2023 with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198217) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198217) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198217). A total of `r tab_fish_summary_updated %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream and `r tab_fish_summary_updated %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-07) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-08) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-09)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-u01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-u02))."))`

<!-- Although dolly varden and cutthrout trout parr (likely 1 year old fish) were captured downstream of the crossing, only cutthrout trout were captured upstream. All fish over 60mm that were captured were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls). -->


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Although replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span with a cost estimated at \$300,000) is tentatively recommended, conditions within the greater watershed should be assessed more comprehensively first to determine how the channel alignment and wetland configuration/capacity (between Water Tower Road and the Skeena River) have been impacted by the installation of roads and Sik-E-Dakh community infrastructure as alternative options may provide greater restoration actions.

<br>

## Conclusion and Recommendations {.unnumbered}

There was more than `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` with gradients less than 10%.  Areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for coho rearing and spawning. In collaboration with the local Sik-E-Dakh community, a plan to gather local knowledge, provide educational opportunities for local community members and eventually rehabilitate this system is being layed out by the Gitksan Watershed Authorities. Recommendations going forward include:

  * If it can be located, conduct an assessment of modelled crossing 8301266, located approximately 375m further up Water Tower Road from crossing 198217. During the assessment, survey upstream and downstream (several hundred meters if possible) to try to determine if (and how much) water flows where this stream segment has been mapped in the freshwater atlas of BC.
  
  * As the extent/duration of seasonal dewatering could decrease and the amount of rearing habitat available increased by encouraging water retention in beaver influenced wetland areas, an inventory of beaver dams, analysis of the watershed with the beaver restoration assessment tool and wetland mapping is recommended. Additionally, we recommend engaging with Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure representatives and contractors to understand site constraints, road maintenance issues and explore the possibility of increasing water storage within the wetland areas located upstream and downstream of the highway.

  * Electrofishing and PIT tagging upstream and downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` (including within the northern tributary that feeds the drinking water intake facility) is recommended to provide insight into fish community composition, density, survival and movement.

  * Acquisition of lidar data for areas to the west of current data available on LidarBC (includes area of water intake facilities) to provide information about potential channel and wetland locations.  Analysis of this data could provide insight into historic channel dredging/redirections and inform restoration actions.

  * Acquisition of temperature data at points likely to contain water all year long (ex. outlet of culverts and upstream of culvert on water tower road). Acquire data for the entire growing season and include areas from main north channel to elevations where coho are expected to populate. The growing season can be defined as per @coleman_fausch2007ColdSummer, which delineate the beginning as the first day of the week that average stream temperatures exceed 5$^\circ$C in the spring and the end as the last day of the week that average stream temperature drops below 4$^\circ$C. 

  * Delineation of reaches and acquisition of habitat data incorporating Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures [@johnston_slaney1996FishHabitat] within all reaches expected to be populated by coho. An adaptation of assessments (ex. degree of channel incision and percentage of floodplain utilized by the stream) developed to informed low-tech process-based restoration activities (beaver dam analogues and post assisted log structures) could be incorporated into FHAP assessments as per @wheaton_etal2019LowTechProcessBased.

  * Acquire high resolution RGB imagery for the entire area from the confluence to above the water intake infrastructure. Include areas on the west side of the highway where there is the remnant channel on the south of water tower culverts and wetland areas to the north.

  * Coho spawner surveys to coincide with known spawning timing in neighbouring systems.

  * Snorkel and/or gopro surveys of plunge pool areas below culverts at times of steelhead and coho migrations to scope for adults attempting to ascend the watershed.

  * Overall outreach program to gather historic fisheries information for the system and to scope for knowledge regarding alterations to the subject stream tradgectory/floodplain. Through this process of two way education, Kispiox valley residents and restoration practitioners could learn/teach about the role of beavers in local watershed health as well as the history of impacts to aquatic values due to road, community, and ranch development in the area.

* Acquisition of hydrometric information in accordance with the Manual of British Columbia Hydrometric Standards [@resourcesinformationstandardscommittee2018ManualBritish] to build stage discharge curves for the watershed so the relationships between fish life history timings, physical habitat suitability, temperature and flows can be better understood.
