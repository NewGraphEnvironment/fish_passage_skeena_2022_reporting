## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. This site is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`, approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Skeena River.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198225)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available for the areas upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.

<br>

The stream was initially assessed on September 23, 2022, with much of this memo drafted then including recommendations for follow up fish sampling. The site was revisited on September 21, 2024. Results from the 2023 site visit is also now included in this updated report.

```{r tab-wshd-198225, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198225). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198225)). There
was high flow through the culvert at the time of survey. A deep
outlet pool (2m) and a large outlet drop (2m) indicate that the
culvert may be undersized. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output("\\pagebreak")}`

```{r tab-culvert-198225, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo()

```

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'ds') %>% pull(comments)
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'us') %>% pull(comments)

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` in 2022 
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198225-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198225-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198225-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Large woody debris was noted as abundant creating deep pools and small cascade steps. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing.

<br>

As noted above, the site was revisited in 2023 with intent to conduct electrofishing - however, before sampling was conducted surveyors observed a 2 - 3m high near vertical cascade flowing over bedrock into the small culvert outlet pool immediately below the FSR so it was decided to not proceed with electrofishing.


## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198225-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198225-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198225-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` This stream has the potential to be fish bearing but the gradient is steep. The bank full depth is very high, with a measured average of 0.8m. There was an abundance of large woody debris that provided functionality to the stream habitat by diverting flow and providing cover. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable rearing habitat.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

As field surveys in the summer of 2023 confirmed a natural barrier (2 - 3m high near vertical cascade flowing over bedrock) immediately adjacent to the outlet of
the crossing, replacement of the culvert
with a bridge would not facilitate upstream fish migration so is not recommended.
