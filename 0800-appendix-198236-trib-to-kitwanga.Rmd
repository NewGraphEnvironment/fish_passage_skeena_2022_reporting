## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Kitwanga River.  The site is ~1.5km upstream of Kitwanga Lake (a.k.a Kitwancool Lake or Gitanyow Lake). 

<br>

Although there are two crossing modelled as between the subject site and the Kitwanga River (modelled_crossing_id
8301996 and 8300438) that have not yet been inventoried, field observations and review of aerial imagery indicates that
the crossing structures have been removed and fish access through this area is not likely hindered.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

Using salmon enumeration facilities to trap and count upstream migrating salmon, the Gitanyow
Fisheries Authorities have demonstrated that Kitwanga Lake is one of the most productive sockeye nursery lakes for its
size in all of BC [@gitanyowfisheriesauthority2023KitwangaRiver]. The Kitwanga River salmon enumeration facility is
located approximately 4km north of the confluence with the Skeena river. This facility provides counts of five species
of salmon: sockeye, chinook, coho, chum, and pink. In response to rapid declines in sockeye stocks, the Kitwanga Lake
Sockeye Restoration project was started in 2006.  Restoration efforts include environmental monitoring of the lake,
assessment of sockeye spawning and rearing habitat, and hatchery rearing [@gottesfeld_etal2009CaseHistory].

<br>

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198236)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available for the areas upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. 

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-198236, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```


<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up by the Society for
Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC following a review of bcfishpass modelling and background literature. A Fish
Habitat Assessment Procedure was completed at this site in 2008 by members of the Skeena Fisheries Commission. At the
time of assessment, it was concluded that the culvert presented a velocity barrier to juveniles. The habitat upstream
was modelled at 8%. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198236). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "kisp", archive_date = "2022-09-06")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198236)). There
was low flow through both culverts at the time of survey. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was abundant overhanging vegetation and a lot of downed trees. The stream mainly consisted of gravels and cobbles. There were infrequent shallow pools suitable for rearing. The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198236-d02))."))`
The average channel width was 3m, the average wetted width was 2.6m, and the average gradient was 5.8%. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. There were abundant gravels noted as suitable for resident and anadromous salmonid spawning. There were frequent deep pools due to large woody debris in the canyon that was not logged. Overall, the habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Although the habitat upstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` was modelled at 8% which is greater than
the steelhead rearing cutoff (7.5%) for high intrinsic potential (ie. likely "good" habitat), the average gradient was
measured at 5.8% indicating that modelling outputs in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198236) under-represent lower
gradient habitat present. A reasonable estimate of the amount of habitat upstream of the crossing that is under 7.5% is
approximately 2km. The areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull =
hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a 
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
