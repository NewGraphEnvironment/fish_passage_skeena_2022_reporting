Mostly cobbles in stream. Wide channel throughout with a lot of woody debris. Large amounts of undercut banks that can provide cover. But not many deep pools. Some steep eroding banks found every  so often.

Multiple channels after first beaver dam, separated by heavily vegetated banks. Muddy bed material with some fines and gravels but nothing bigger. More gravels closer to downstream culvert that are suitable for spawning. Deep pools near wetland that can be suitable for rearing if habitat is opened up. 10:13:24"

Wide stream with numerous cascades and deep pools below. Two dams noted as upstream in provincial data layers (800m and 1000m upstream of the crossing) with upstream dam likely related to drinking water intake for Kispiox comminity but unconfirmed.  Lower dam confirmed as not present. Large outlet drop. Site revisited in 2023 to conduct electrofishing.

Bed material consists of towels and boulders, also there are small packets of gravel suitable for spawning. Some features may be barrier natural barriers to Fish Passage, although during high flow there's a good chance strong fish can make it up. Plenty of pools available for fish to habituate, large wooden debris and small woody debris as well as boulders are quite functional and force complexity into the stream,. Stream is located mostly in a bed rock canyon, shrubs hang over the stream, taking up about 2 m on either side of the bank. 11:27:01"

Because the stream was primarily dewatered downstream of the outlet pool this site consisted of the outlet pool only. Only a portion of the fish present in the outlet pool were sampled due to time constraints. 12:48:19
22,Tributary to Owen Creek,197379_us_ef1,197379,us,ef1,2022-09-15,13:04:00,AI,11,,,,,,235.5s electrofishing. Shallow pools with very large boulder on right bank flat faced area isolated pocket because the majority of the channel is the water. Two passes of the same site we're done but fish or not separated into passes. Some uncertainty about whether Fish marked as cutthroat or actually rainbow. There are yellow slashes under the chin but the mouth does not reach past the eye and we haven't seen any larger age class fish with the/us. The big fish all appear to be rainbow having a suspect that the small ones may also be remote. Unless they're hybrids. During the fish processing process it appeared that it is very likely that all of the fish that were classified as cutthroat were actually rainbow. We didn't find any larger fish with red slashes and as the fish got larger it appeared the yellow slight yellow slashes underneath the chins caught lighter and lighter. 13:04:29

Site revisited in 2023 to conduct fish sampling however surveyors observed a 2-3m high near vertical cascade flowing over bedrock into the small outlet pool just below the FSR.  Site no longer considered priority as fish passage will not be rectified by structure replacement.

Draft design completed for replacement by Ministry of Forests. Habitat confirmation assessment was conducted at the site in 2021 with the site revisited for fish sampling (electrofishing and tagging) in the summers of 2022 and 2023.  Good flow present in 2021 however, stream contained only isolated pools in 2022 with fish captured tagged with PIT tags.  Site revisited in 2023 to resample however no water was present except small outlet pool.  One fish was observed in the outlet pool in 2023 (rainbow trout ~110mm long with no tag present) and one PIT tag was discovered in a dry area of the channel near the outlet pool.  All areas fished in 2022 - both upstream and downstream of the FSR - were scanned with PIT tag reader in 2023 however only the one tag was discovered downstream.  Abundant undercut banks with some pools. Healthy riparian vegetation providing cover and woody debris to habitat. "
