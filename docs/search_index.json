"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction In April of 2020, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) undertook an initiative to plan and conduct fish passage restoration planning activities in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed. The initiative was supported by a grant from the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund that leveraged funds committed in the fall of 2019 from the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation. New Graph Environment and Hillcrest Geographics were the project team subcontracted to devise the study plan, submit proposals and complete the work which included information gathering, updating/implementation of open source data analysis tools, fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments. Although fish passage restoration planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries. In August of 2020, following a province wide prioritization exercise and a series of workshops, the Canadian Wildlife Federation selected the Bulkley River watershed group as a target watershed for connectivity planning efforts supported by a grant from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund. A Fish Passage Working Group consisting of First Nations, non-profits, stakeholder groups and regulators was established for the Bulkley River watershed group in the fall of 2020 as documented in Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). Recognizing synergies between the two initiatives, select project activities of both initiatives became a collaboration between SERNbc and CWF with extensive input from numerous organizations and individuals connected to the watersheds. This report builds on reporting from field activities conducted in 2021 (Irvine 2021) and 2022 which can be viewed interactively here and here. Please note that at the time of reporting, this document was a living document changing over time. Version numbers are logged for each release with modifications, enhancements and other changes tracked here with issues tracked here. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Wet’suwet’en 2.2 Gitxsan 2.3 Project Location 2.4 Fisheries 2.5 Fish Passage Restoration Planning and Implementation 2.6 Morice river", " 2 Background The study area includes the Bulkley River, Zymoetz River, Kispiox River and Morice River watershed groups (Figure 2.1) and is within the traditional territories of the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en. 2.1 Wet’suwet’en Wet’suwet’en hereditary territory covers an area of 22,000km2 including the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds and portions of the Nechako River watershed. The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). 2.2 Gitxsan Gitxsan means “People of the River Mist”. The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (“Gitxsan Huwilp Government” 2021). Its people reside in the communities of Hazelton, Kispiox and Glen Vowell (the Eastern Gitxsan bands) and Kitwanga, Kitwankool and Kitsegukla (the Western Gitxsan). The original Gitxsan economy depended heavily on the trade of fish and other natural resources with neighbouring First Nations along “grease trails,” which are routes named so because they carried the refined oil of the oolichan, a fish that resembles a smelt that is common in some areas of British Columbia. They are also known for their range of traditional arts (j_v_powelletal_GitxsanCanadian?). # Salmon is considered the source of life and always treated with high regard. It was brought by the Raven who also taught people how to fish and hunt. 2.3 Project Location knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/BulkelyMoriceOverview2.jpeg&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Areas 2.3.1 Bulkley River The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762 km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.2 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 19.4 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures 2.2 and 2.4). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (IPCC 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization (ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004 - daily discharge data from 1930 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River near Houston (Station #08EE003 - daily discharge data from 1980 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) 2.3.2 Morice River The Morice River watershed drains 4,379 km2 of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only (Environment and limate Change Canada 2021). An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it’s confluence with the Bulkley River is 113.3 m3/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at 75.4 m3/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures 2.5 - 2.6). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED003.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Left: Hydrograph for Morice River near Houston (Station #08ED003 - 1971 data only).

Available daily discharge data from 1961 to 2018. 2.3.3 Zymoetz River The Zymoetz River (known locally as the Copper River) watershed is an eighth order stream that drains an area of 3,028 km2 in a generally westerly direction. It is considered a major tributary of the Skeena River, as it contributes approximately 10% of the flow. The headwater lakes are located approximately 20km southwest of Smithers, and they include Aldrich, Dennis and McDonell Lakes. The upper and lower portions of the watershed are accessed via logging roads off of Highway 16 from Smithers and Terrace, respectively. Access to the middle watershed is difficult due to road wash out. The Zymoetz River flows roughly 120km, starting just west of Hudson Bay mountain near Smithers and ending at the confluence of the Skeena River, approximately 8km north-east of Terrace. Elevations in the watershed range from 120m at the confluence, to 2740m in the Howson Range. The lower end of the Zymoetz watershed has seen a significant reduction in riparian habitat due to fires, forest development practices, pipe line and road construction (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). Snowmelt plays a big role in controlling the stream hydrology, with a mean annual discharge estimated at 105.3 m3/s at station 08EF005 located near Smithers. Peak discharge happens in May to early June, which is typical of a high elevation watershed like this (Figures 2.7 - 2.8). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EF005.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) Figure 2.7: Hydrograph for Zymoetz River (Station #08EF005). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EF005.png&quot;) Figure 2.8: Summary of hydrology statistics for Zymoetz River (Station #08EF005 - Lat 54.116829 Lon -127.426582). Available daily discharge data from 1997 to 2021. 2.3.4 Kispiox River The Kispiox River watershed is a seventh order stream that drains an area of 2,088km2 in a south east direction. It is a large tributary of the Skeena River, contributing approximately 9% of its flow. It flows 140km to the confluence of the Skeena River, located near Kispiox Village. Elevations in the watershed range from 200m at the mouth to as high as 2090m on Kispiox Mountain. The mainstream of the Kispiox is fed mainly by glacier melt and high elevation snow melt. Swan and Stephens Lakes (located in the upper watershed) are important sockeye systems. Swan Lake drains via Club Lake into Stephens Lake which in turn flows via Stephens Creek into the mainstem of the Kispiox River. Some of the biggest threats to aquatic ecosystems in the Kispiox valley are reported as erosion, obstructions, sedimentation, and altered water yield. The upper third of the Kispiox watershed (upstream of the Nangeese River) is well protected from develpment by the Swan Lake Kispiox River Provincial Park and because it contains few roads with little forestry development (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Kispiox River has a mean annual discharge estimated at 45 m3/s at station 08EB004 located near Hazelton. Peak discharge happens in May and June as a result of the spring snowmelt (Figures 2.9 - 2.10). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EB004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) Figure 2.9: Hydrograph for Kispiox River near Hazelton (Station #08EB004). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EB004.png&quot;) Figure 2.10: Summary of hydrology statistics for Kispiox River near Hazelton (Station #08EB004). Available daily discharge data from 1963 to 2021. 2.4 Fisheries In 2004, IBM Business Consulting Services (2006) estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars. The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery (Tamblyn 2005). 2.4.1 Bulkley River Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) detail numerous fishing areas located within the lower Bulkley drainage (from the confluence of the Skeena to the confluence with the Telkwa River) and the upper Bulkley drainage which includes the mainstem Bulkley River and tributaries upstream of the Telkwa River confluence. Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (Wilson and Rabnett 2007; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). Approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Bulkley River, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972 (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Bulkley River is considered Class II water and there is no fishing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.4.2 Morice River Detailed reviews of Morice River watershed fisheries can be found in Bustard and Schell (2002), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002), Schell (2003), A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007), and ILMB (2007) with a comprehensive review of water quality by Oliver (2018). Overall, the Morice watershed contains high fisheries values as a major producer of chinook, pink, sockeye, coho and steelhead. 2.4.3 Zymoetz River Within the Zymoetz Watershed, there are many areas with high fishery values. Steelhead are the most extensively documented fish species in the Zymoetz River watershed. Adults enter the river from JUly to November and then go on to spawn the following year in late spring to early summer. The Zymoetz River is a relatively steep system. Two canyons are located 6.4 and 19.6 kilometers upstream of the Skeena River confluence. These canyons make access to the Zymoetz difficult for pink and chum salmon (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Zymoetz River is renowned for its aggressive steelhead that have been known to take flies or lures. There is a 50km stretch upstream of Limonite Creek where the Zymoetz River is a designated Class I water. This section is remote and offers high quality fishing opportunities for anglers (Zymoetz1_AMP.pdf?). Traditional First Nations use of the upper Zymoetz River watershed by the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people differed between community sites, residences, and fish houses, and was large and diverse. From the upper to lower Zymoetz River and to the Skeena River, a significant ancient grease trail connected, with a branch track forking through Limonite Creek and flowing down the Telkwa River. The fishery used a weir at the mouth of McDonell Lake and spears at Six Mile Flats, near Dennis Lake. There is no information on native fisheries on the lower Zymoetz River. The Zymoetz is considered to be one of the top ten steelhead rivers in BC (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.4.4 Kispiox River Kispiox River salmon are a important food source and cultural symbol for the Gitxsan people with sockeye and coho historically the two most significant species. Gitangwalk and Lax Didax, two significant villages that were both abandoned in the early 1900s, were situated on the Kispiox in such a way as to block the sockeye and coho salmon’s upstream migration to the Upper Kispiox River spawning grounds providing opportunities to gather and preserve a significant amount of high-quality food over relatively short time periods (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). About 100 km of the mainstem and 300 km of the tributary streams in the Kispiox River Watershed are considering high value fish habitat as they are a migration route and support spawning and rearing for many fish species. The Kispiox fisheries supports both recreational and commercial fishing while also enhancing the ecology, nutrient regime, and structural diversity of the drainage. Since 1992, sockeye and coho escapements from the Kispiox Watershed have been documented by the Gitxsan Watershed Authorities as they creates strong cultural, economic, and symbolic ties for the local communities (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.4.4.1 Fish Species Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020). Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena and Bulkley River fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure 2.11. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned. In the 1990’s the Morice River watershed, A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007). Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most (Bustard and Schell 2002). Bustard and Schell (2002) report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. ##### Chinook # In the 1990&#39;s Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have recorded juvenile chinook rearing in small non natal streams. # @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have uvenile chinook have been recorded rearing in small non natal streams #It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation – Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 2.5.1 Bulkley River There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system. A non-exhaustive list of historic fish passage reports for the watershed includes Wilson and Rabnett (2007), McCarthy and Fernando (2015),Smith (2018) Casselman and Stanley (2010) and Irvine (2018). Review of the PSCIS database indicated that prior to 2021, 1665 assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) at crossing structures within the Bulkley River watershed group have been recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021a). No habitat confirmations are recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021b). Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek (MoE 2021c). McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and a design is currently being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek (pers. comm. Kathryn Graham, Regional Manager Environmental Services - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure). ##`r pscis_historic_phase1 %&gt;% filter(watershed_group_code %ilike% &#39;BULK&#39; &amp; assessment_date &lt; &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% nrow()` 2.6 Morice river Within the Morice River watershed group prior to 2021, 21 fish passage assessments (Phase 1) had been recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021a). At the time of reporting, no habitat confirmations had been recorded (MoE 2021b). Two culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS in the and include works on a tributary to the Morice River located at km 39.2 of the Morice River FSR and on bridge installation at km 4 of McBride Road on a tributary to McBride Lake (MoE 2021c). ##`r pscis_historic_phase1 %&gt;% filter(watershed_group_code %ilike% &#39;MORR&#39; &amp; assessment_date &lt; &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% nrow()` "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["session-info.html", "Session Info", " Session Info xfun::session_info() R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit) Running under: , RStudio 2022.12.0.353 Locale: en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 / C / en_US.UTF-8 / en_US.UTF-8 Package version: AsioHeaders_1.22.1.1 askpass_1.1 assertthat_0.2.1 backports_1.4.1 base64enc_0.1-3 bcdata_0.3.1 BH_1.78.0.0 bibtex_0.4.2.3 bit_4.0.4 bit64_4.0.5 bitops_1.0-7 blob_1.2.3 bookdown_0.27 boot_1.3.28 brew_1.0-7 broom_1.0.0 bslib_0.3.1 cachem_1.0.6 callr_3.7.0 cellranger_1.1.0 chk_0.8.0 chron_2.3-57 citr_0.3.2 class_7.3-20 classInt_0.4-7 cli_3.4.1 clipr_0.8.0 codetools_0.2-18 colorspace_2.0-3 commonmark_1.8.0 compiler_4.2.1 cpp11_0.4.3 crayon_1.5.1 crosstalk_1.2.0 crul_1.2.0 curl_4.3.3 data.table_1.14.2 datapasta_3.1.0 DBI_1.1.3 dbplyr_2.2.1 digest_0.6.29 doParallel_1.0.17 dplyr_1.0.10 dtplyr_1.2.1 e1071_1.7-11 elevatr_0.4.2 ellipsis_0.3.2 english_1.2-6 evaluate_0.15 exifr_0.3.2 fansi_1.0.3 farver_2.1.1 fasstr_0.4.1 fastmap_1.1.0 fishbc_0.2.1.9000 fitdistrplus_1.1.8 fontawesome_0.2.2 forcats_0.5.1 foreach_1.5.2 foreign_0.8-82 fpr_0.1.0.9005 fs_1.5.2 furrr_0.3.1 future_1.28.0 fwapgr_0.1.0.9011 gargle_1.2.0 generics_0.1.3 geojson_0.3.4 geojsonio_0.9.5 geojsonsf_2.0.3 geometries_0.2.0 ggdark_0.2.1 ggmap_3.0.0.903 ggplot2_3.3.6 globals_0.16.1 glue_1.6.2 googledrive_2.0.0 googlePolylines_0.8.2 googlesheets4_1.0.0 googleway_2.7.6 graphics_4.2.1 grDevices_4.2.1 grid_4.2.1 gridExtra_2.3 gtable_0.3.0 haven_2.5.0 highr_0.9 hms_1.1.1 htmltools_0.5.2 htmlwidgets_1.5.4 httpcode_0.3.0 httpuv_1.6.5 httr_1.4.4 ids_1.0.1 isoband_0.2.5 iterators_1.0.14 janitor_2.1.0 jpeg_0.1-9 jqr_1.2.3 jquerylib_0.1.4 jsonify_1.2.1 jsonlite_1.8.4 kableExtra_1.3.4 Kendall_2.2.1 KernSmooth_2.23-20 knitr_1.40 labeling_0.4.2 later_1.3.0 lattice_0.20-45 lazyeval_0.2.2 leafem_0.2.0 leaflet_2.1.1 leaflet.extras_1.0.0 leaflet.providers_1.9.0 leafpop_0.1.0 lifecycle_1.0.3 listenv_0.8.0 lubridate_1.8.0 magick_2.7.3 magrittr_2.0.3 maptools_1.1-4 markdown_1.1 MASS_7.3.57 Matrix_1.4.1 memoise_2.0.1 methods_4.2.1 mgcv_1.8.41 mime_0.12 miniUI_0.1.1.1 modelr_0.1.8 munsell_0.5.0 nabor_0.5.0 nlme_3.1.157 openssl_2.0.3 openxlsx_4.2.5 pacman_0.5.1 pagedown_0.18 parallel_4.2.1 parallelly_1.32.1 pdftools_3.3.0 PearsonDS_1.2.2 pgfeatureserv_0.0.0.9002 pillar_1.8.1 pkgconfig_2.0.3 plogr_0.2.0 plyr_1.8.7 png_0.1-7 poisspatial_0.1.0.9000 poisutils_0.0.0.9010 prettyunits_1.1.1 processx_3.8.0 progress_1.2.2 progressr_0.10.1 promises_1.2.0.1 protolite_2.1.1 proxy_0.4-27 ps_1.7.2 purrr_0.3.5 qpdf_1.2.0 R6_2.5.1 rapidjsonr_1.2.0 rappdirs_0.3.3 raster_3.5-21 rayimage_0.6.2 rayshader_0.24.10 RColorBrewer_1.1.3 Rcpp_1.0.9 RcppArmadillo_0.11.2.0.0 RcppEigen_0.3.3.9.2 RcppRoll_0.3.0 readr_2.1.2 readwritesqlite_0.1.2 readxl_1.4.0 RefManageR_1.3.0 rematch_1.0.1 rematch2_2.1.2 remotes_2.4.2 reprex_2.0.1 rgdal_1.5-32 rgeos_0.5-9 rgl_0.109.2 RgoogleMaps_1.4.5.3 rlang_1.0.6 rmarkdown_2.14 RPostgres_1.4.4 RPostgreSQL_0.7-3 RSQLite_2.2.14 rstudioapi_0.14 rvest_1.0.2 s2_1.0.7 sass_0.4.1 scales_1.2.0 selectr_0.4.2 servr_0.24 sf_1.0-7 sfheaders_0.4.0 shiny_1.7.1 shinyjs_2.1.0 slippymath_0.3.1 snakecase_0.11.0 sourcetools_0.1.7 sp_1.5-0 splines_4.2.1 stats_4.2.1 stringi_1.7.8 stringr_1.5.0 survival_3.3.1 svglite_2.1.0 sys_3.4 systemfonts_1.0.4 terra_1.5-34 terrainmeshr_0.1.0 tibble_3.1.8 tidyhydat_0.5.5 tidyr_1.2.0 tidyselect_1.2.0 tidyverse_1.3.1 tinytex_0.40 tools_4.2.1 triebeard_0.3.0 tzdb_0.3.0 units_0.8-0 urltools_1.7.3 utf8_1.2.2 utils_4.2.1 uuid_1.1-0 V8_4.2.1 vctrs_0.5.1 viridis_0.6.2 viridisLite_0.4.0 vroom_1.5.7 webshot_0.5.3 websocket_1.4.1 withr_2.5.0 wk_0.6.0 xfun_0.35 XML_3.99.0.10 xml2_1.3.3 xtable_1.8-4 yaml_2.3.5 yesno_0.1.2 zip_2.2.0 zyp_0.10.1.1 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
